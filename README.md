2. Include the following files:
  - `index.html` for the landing page structure and semantics
  - `style.css` which is externally linked to the HTML document
3. In the `index.html`, include the following features:
  A. Header bar
    I. Logo
    II. Three header links
  B. Hero section
    I. Left subsection
      a. Hero
      b. Description
      c. Sign up button
    II. Placeholder image
  C. Info section
    I. Header
    II. Four info items
      a. Placeholder image
      b. Image subtext
  D. Quote section
    I. Quote section
    II. Author attribution

    I. Left subsection
      a. Call to action
      b. Description
    II. Sign up button

    I. Copyright information
4. In the `style.css`, include the following features:
  - Center most section content
  - Pad section content to preserve background colors that extend width of viewport
  - Use `i` tag over `em` for quote since italics are visual and do not influence meaning for screen readers
  - Prefer font weight style for quote attribution over a header option to preserve semantics of page
  - Use a `div` for hero image to provide placeholder caption
  - Use `div` for information items instead of images to provide empty features with borders
